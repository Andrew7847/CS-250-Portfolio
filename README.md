#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  User needs can be translated into the simple format of “As a <user>, I want to <goal> so that <reason>”. These user stories can then easily be translated into code by primarily analyzing the "goal" portion of the user story which ultimately describes the output of the feature in question. For instance, the user may want to search a database for information on a sports team. A feature can then be developed which returns the necessary data that the user has requested.
#How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  I begin development work in several ways. In a test-driven approach, I would first look at the goal that the user has defined, and then design tests that ensure the program does the correct thing. Code is then developed to satisfy this test at a bare minimum until it successfully passes. The code is then "bulked-out" to account for more inputs, potentially failing points, etc. Another approach is to create pseudocode of the program that has been requested, and then translate that pseudocode into a functional program.
#What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  The number one thing when it comes to being a good team member is communication. Without communication a team will undoubtedly fail. This is especially true in software development where a number of teams must work simultaneously to create one functional deliverable on time for a customer. Another aspect of being a good team member is being open to criticism and acknowledge your failures as that is ultimately how we learn.
